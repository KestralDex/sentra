# TODO List for Adding Background Image to Webapp

- [x] Edit `frontend/vite-project/src/index.css` to add the background image to the body element with appropriate CSS properties (background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-color as fallback).
- [x] Run the development server to verify the background image appears correctly across the webapp.
